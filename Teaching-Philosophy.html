												<h2>My Teaching-Philosophy</h2>
											</header>

											

											<p>My Teaching philosphy has been developed by reflecting on experiences. By completing my high school certificate, undergoing my apprentiship in hospitality and undergoing university, I have developed a strong teaching philiophy in how I want to teach students in the way my teachers tought me.  </p>

											<h3>Philosphy:</h3>
											<p>My philosphy has been created and formed from my past teachers in high school. These teachers were my favourite teachers in Hospitality and Timber Technology. They would always offer 
												support and offered guidance, they were my rolemodels and were good at thier jobs. I want to be like these teachers as they are the reason I became a teacher. My philosphyis to become a teacher like these teachers as I want student to look up to me for support and guidance. 
											     </p>

											<p>I aim to be respectful, a rolemodel and a professional teacher. I aim to always try my best to teach students. My philiophy is that a teacher should be kind, always 
												try their best to teach students of all socioeconomic backgrounds and always be supportive. A good teacher is understandng, patient, kind and understadning.  </p>
